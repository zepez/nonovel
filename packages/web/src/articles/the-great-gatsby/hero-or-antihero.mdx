In F. Scott Fitzgerald's iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, the character of Jay Gatsby has been a subject of much debate. Is he a hero or an antihero? Gatsby is undoubtedly one of the most complex literary characters of the twentieth century, and his portrayal raises questions about the nature of heroism. While some critics argue that Gatsby is more of an antihero, others contend that he possesses qualities of a hero. By examining Gatsby's egoism, moral ambiguity, transformation into a tragic hero, and the contrast between him and other characters, we can gain a deeper understanding of his character and determine whether he fits the mold of a hero or an antihero.

### Gatsby's Egoism and Misplaced Values

One of the key arguments for Gatsby being an antihero is his egoism and misplaced values. Gatsby is a character driven by his own desires and is willing to sacrifice anything to attain his dream. His obsession with Daisy Buchanan is evident throughout the novel, and he goes to great lengths to win her back, including throwing lavish parties and buying an extravagant mansion just to be near her. Gatsby's desire for Daisy seems to cloud his judgment and disregard Daisy's feelings. When Nick warns him that he is expecting too much from Daisy, Gatsby responds incredulously, believing that he can repeat the past and recapture Daisy's love. This close-minded outlook and lack of consideration for others are typical of an antihero, who often exhibits egotism and misplaced values.

### Gatsby's Moral Ambiguity

Another aspect of Gatsby's character that supports the argument for him being an antihero is his moral ambiguity. While Gatsby may appear to be a romantic figure pursuing his love for Daisy, his actions reveal a lack of moral standards. The entire premise of The Great Gatsby revolves around Gatsby's attempt to steal another man's wife, a morally questionable act. Despite his outward displays of wealth and success, Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is driven by his own desires rather than genuine love. He is willing to go to great lengths to possess her, even if it means resorting to deceit and criminal activities. Gatsby's loose moral standards align more with the traits of an antihero rather than a traditional hero.

### Gatsby's Transformation into a Tragic Hero

However, some argue that Gatsby's character undergoes a transformation throughout the novel, ultimately making him a tragic hero. Gatsby's tragic flaw, his hamartia, is his relentless pursuit of an unattainable dream. He is willing to sacrifice everything for his love for Daisy, including his own reputation and ultimately his life. Gatsby's devotion to Daisy is both admirable and tragic, as it leads to his downfall. When Daisy confesses that she once loved Tom, Gatsby's dream crumbles, and he realizes the futility of his pursuit. This moment of anagnorisis, when Gatsby realizes the truth about Daisy and his dream, aligns with Aristotle's definition of a tragic hero. Despite his flaws, Gatsby's transformation into a tragic hero evokes sympathy and admiration from the reader.

### Contrast with Other Characters

To further analyze Gatsby's character, it is essential to consider the contrast between him and other characters in the novel. One significant contrast is between Gatsby and Tom Buchanan. Tom, an affluent and arrogant individual, represents the traditional notion of a hero due to his wealth and upper-class roots. In contrast, Gatsby, a self-made man from West Egg with a mysterious past, does not fit the conventional hero archetype. However, as the story progresses, Gatsby's actions reveal his true character. While Tom engages in morally questionable behavior and shows little regard for others, Gatsby displays acts of bravery, nobility, and self-sacrifice. This contrast suggests that heroism can come from unexpected sources and challenges the notion that heroes must conform to societal expectations.

### The Narrator's Perspective: Nick Carraway

The perspective of the narrator, Nick Carraway, also plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of Gatsby's character. Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby are tainted by his own prejudices and reservations. He views Gatsby with "unaffected scorn" and describes him as a distant and flamboyant figure. However, as Nick becomes more entwined in Gatsby's world and witnesses his devotion to Daisy, his perception of Gatsby changes. Nick begins to appreciate Gatsby's dream and the sacrifices he makes for love. By the end of the novel, Nick finds himself on Gatsby's side, suggesting that Gatsby's actions have transformed him into a hero in Nick's eyes.

### Gatsby as a Romantic Hero

An alternative perspective is to view Gatsby as a romantic hero. The romantic hero rejects societal norms and conventions and often finds themselves at odds with society. Gatsby's withdrawal from society, his pursuit of an unattainable love, and his willingness to protect Daisy align with the characteristics of a romantic hero. His love for Daisy becomes his central focus, akin to a knight's quest for the Holy Grail. Gatsby's willingness to sacrifice himself for Daisy's reputation and his desire to protect her despite her flaws and betrayal exemplify the traits of a romantic hero. This interpretation challenges the notion that Gatsby is merely an antihero and suggests that he possesses heroic qualities.

### Gatsby's Criminality and Morality

Another argument for Gatsby being an antihero stems from his involvement in criminal activities. Gatsby's rumored association with bootlegging and his lavish parties hint at his involvement in illicit activities. While Gatsby's criminality may initially paint him as an antihero, it is essential to consider the context of the Prohibition era in which the novel is set. Many individuals during this time engaged in illegal activities due to the ban on alcohol. Gatsby's criminality is a reflection of the corrupt society in which he exists and does not necessarily define his moral character. Despite his involvement in illegal activities, Gatsby displays a sense of morality by taking responsibility for Myrtle's death to protect Daisy.

### Gatsby as an Unlikely Hero

In conclusion, Gatsby's character in The Great Gatsby is complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to label him definitively as a hero or an antihero. While he exhibits traits of both, the evidence suggests that he possesses heroic qualities despite his flaws. Gatsby's transformation into a tragic hero, his acts of bravery and sacrifice, and the contrast between him and other characters support the argument that he is more of an unlikely hero than an antihero. Ultimately, Gatsby's character challenges traditional notions of heroism and highlights the complexity of human nature.
